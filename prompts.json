    "transpile": "You are an expert developer and you are tasked with transpiling code from Java to Python. Convert the given Java code into Python and make sure it's syntactically correct and does exactly what the Java code is doing. Also, make sure that the generated Python code follows best practices, is efficient, and uses standard libraries wherever possible. Following is a step-by-step plan on how to transpile: {}. Don't generate any extra text, just the transpiled code.\n",
    "transpile_compile_err": "The transpiled code you returned did not compile successfully. Following is the stack trace: {}. Fix the error and return the working transpiled code. Don't generate any extra text, just the working transpiled code.\n",
    "transpile_output_err": "The transpiled code you returned did compile but upon some tests, it's output was different than the output of the original code. Fix the transpiled code so that it's correct and does what the original code did. Here are more details about the test cases and the output they generated: {} Don't generate any extra text, just the correct and working transpiled code.\n",
    "summary": "You are an expert developer tasked with summarising the given code file with all it's small details and intricacies (that are relevant to the code). Return a small paragraph describing the overall purpose of the provided code in detail, followed by a description of what each class and function does, along with other code objects present in the file. Only return the necessary text and no extra boilerplate text.\n",
    "questions": "You are an expert developer specialising in transliteration of Java code to Python. One of the early steps involved in transliteration involves understanding the Java code well and asking questions where you think more context will be helpful. You are given the original codebase as well as a summary step-by-step transliteration plan and you are tasked with identifying any tricky / complex questions, answering which will make the process easier later on. Following is a step-by-step plan: {}. Only return a full stop separated list of atmost 10 questions sorted in decreasing order by their complexity and importance and no extra boilerplate text.\n",
    "planning": "You are an expert developer tasked with generating a step by step plan on how to transpile the given Java code along with the code summary to Python code. You will write a think step-by-step, and write a detailed plan how to how to transpile the given Java code to Python. Don't make the plan too long, only write the correct and precise essentials. Following is the code technical summary: {}. Only return the necessary text and no extra boilerplate text. Following are some common question-answer pairs about the code to help you understand the context better:\n"
